### Hi there 👋

My name's Luke. I'm a front end developer currently working [@thought-machine](https://github.com/thought-machine) using React ⚛!

I consider myself a generalist, familliar with many languages including JS, TS, Golang, Python; and I'm currently learning C/C++ & Rust 🦀.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building a react style reconciller in C++ ⚛
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++ & Rust
- 💬 Ask me about anything 😁

- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to make music in my spare time and I'm building a modular synthesizer 🎹

Here are some noteworthy projects of mine I encourage you to take a look at:

#### [luk707/games](https://github.com/luk707/games)
> I'm using this project to tap back into graphics programming (which is how I taugt myself to code when I was 13 🐥), and, to continue learning C++ and Bazel.

#### [luk707/rehype-truncate](https://github.com/luk707/rehype-truncate)
> This project is a plugin for rehype which allows you to truncate strings of HTML whilst preserving the structure. It's useful to generate rich excerpts for blogs & documentation and has more than a few dependents now 📈.

#### [luk707/envup](https://github.com/luk707/envup)
> Envup is a project I worked on a few years ago to solve working with environment variables as a team. It reads from a `env.json` file in the present working directory, and prompts the user to populate their `.env` files. This is version controllable too!

#### [luk707/ScientificCalculator](https://github.com/luk707/ScientificCalculator)
> This little project helped me learn more about how lexer's and parser's work. The only input is a string of the mathematical expression, this program tokenises the string, and executes the expression while respecting the order of operations!

#### [luk707/Practice-Project](https://github.com/luk707/Practice-Project/tree/feature/stack/basegameplay)
> This was a project submitted to a hackathon I built in a team of four. I built tools to load and render 3D models from blender using WebGL with no external libraries other than Angular for the user interface while my team members built on top of this to make a clone of the mobile game Stack.
